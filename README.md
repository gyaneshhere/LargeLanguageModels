Welcome! In this repository you will find the code for all examples

## Table of Contents

We advise to run all examples through Google Colab for the easiest setup. Google Colab allows you to use a T4 GPU with 16GB of VRAM for free. All examples were mainly built and tested using Google Colab, so it should be the most stable platform. However, any other cloud provider should work.

> You can check the [setup](.setup/) folder for a quick-start guide to install all packages locally and you can check the [conda](.setup/conda/) folder for a complete guide on how to setup your environment, including conda and PyTorch installation.
> Note that the depending on your OS, Python version, and dependencies your results might be slightly differ. However, they
> should this be similar to the examples in the book.
